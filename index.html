Dear TestNotice Customer,
</p>
<p>
I write you today with a heavy heart because effective November, 30th 2020 we will be closing down our notification services platform. Over the past five years, we have sent hundreds of thousands of notifications, but, partially due to the COVID-19 crisis, unfortunately were unable to achieve the growth we believe is necessary to justify a continuation of services. It has been our pleasure to assist our customers with their testing logistics. 
</p>
<p>
Between now and November 30th, 2020 all services will remain operational. For our court and law-enforcement partners with dedicated portals, final invoices will be issued for services on November 28th, 2020. For individual customers who pay out-of-pocket for our monthly services, final pro-rated invoices will be issued on November 30th, 2020 and your subscription will be terminated.
</p>
<p>
Thank you all for being TestNotice customers. If there are any questions, comments, or concerns please do not hesitate to contact our support team via email at support@testnotice.com.</p>

&mdash; The TestNotice Team
